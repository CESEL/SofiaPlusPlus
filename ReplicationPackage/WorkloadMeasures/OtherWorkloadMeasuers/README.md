# Other/Failed/Problematic Workload Measures

The code in these r-scripts are "use at your own risk". They represent the many attempts at quantifying workload. As we discuss in the paper, the workload is skewed, so average workload is not meaningful. We attempted measures of skewness and kurtosis and found the unitless numbers difficult to describe and compare.
